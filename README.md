## Homework

### H1) Show items in subfolder of movies working directory
Output should be something like this

```
-> Movie ABC (2001)
    - FileA.mkv
    - FileB.srt
    # number of files: 2
-> Movie CDE (1994)
    - FileA.mkv
    - FileB.srt
    - FileC.info
    # number of files: 3
```

Even nicer output but focus on that after the first version

```
-> Movie ABC (2001) [#2]
    - FileA.mkv
    - FileB.srt
-> Movie CDE (1994) [#3]
    - FileA.mkv
    - FileB.srt
    - FileC.info
```
